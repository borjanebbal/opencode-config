Before modifying code, briefly summarize current behavior, identify invariants and side effects that must not change, and preserve all public APIs. Do not alter business logic unless explicitly instructed, prefer small incremental improvements over large rewrites, avoid speculative abstractions, and preserve performance characteristics unless a justified improvement is made. After changes, clearly explain what was improved and, if tests exist, run them to verify no regressions were introduced; if tests do not exist, suggest minimal regression tests.",
